Chapter 1- Origins

3 planets, 3 races, 3 origins. First, would be the Elves, they are blessed by nature but tortured by their own intelligence. Second, would be the Dwarves, full of passion and innovation but relationships severed by greed. Last, would be the Orcs, their strength cannot be unmatched but their bloodlust is something that cannot be quenched. Every planet has their own weakness but that weakness can also be their strength. 
All 3 planets have one goal, is to claim the sun as their own. Thus, creating the unending war called the "Uneven". Since the 3 planets share the same sun, their planets are getting uneven source of light which destroys part of their own worlds and the only way they can think of in order to survive is to destroy the other worlds.
